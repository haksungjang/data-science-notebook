# Interactive Data Visualization for the Web
# Chapter 1
My personal notes from the book :)

## Why Data Visualization
 - Visualizing data is the fastest way to communicate it to others/
 - Humans are intensely visual creatures (even young children can interpret bar charts)
 - Data Visualization - expert storytelling
 - Warning: Visualization like words, can be used to lie, mislead, or distort the truth!

## Why interactive?
    - Dynamic, interactive visualizations can empower people to explroe the data for themselves.
    - History: Ben Shneiderman (in 1996) of Univ. of Maryland proposed the design pattern of “Visual Information-Seeking Mantra”: overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on demand.

## Why on the Web?
    - "Visualizations aren't truly visual unless they are seen."

# Key takeaways:
    - D3 itself is not so complicated, but it operates in the domain of the web, and the web is complicated.
    - Visualization may be a method of expert storytelling, but it may also be used to distort the truth so be wary of the impact your visualizations may have on the internet/ world.
