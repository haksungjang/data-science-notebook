    "- popular misconception that the era of big data means the end of a need for sampling, when in fact the rapid increase of data reinforces the need for sampling as a tool to work efficiently and to minimize bias\n",
    "- modern statistics focuses on the sample data and its empirical distribution WHERE **assumptions are not needed** while traditional statistics focused much on population using theory based on strong assumptions"
